# Purpose of this project

I wanted to get to know how to create RESTful API in GO according to the best practices, applying idiomatic project
structure and not building another CSharpish or FSharpish GO project. Basically, to develop something easily
understandable by the GO community.

Apart from stuff inspired and partially taken from referenced in the Credits section, introduced independent vertical
slices approach to make it easily extendable. The very first slice can be found in the `files` subdirectory

# How to run?

Just run `make run` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`

# What next?

Then it will be the starting point for my (if any) GO projects and further exploration.
